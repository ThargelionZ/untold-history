                            <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>In the year 1729, in a location called Dukandarra in Guinea (West Africa), a child was born and given the name Broteer Furro. Broteer descended from a line of much larger people, who would tower over six feet in height. Broteer’s father was a prince, and his mother was one of his father’s three wives. From a young age, Broteer was given the assignment to watch over sheep. He did this for a long while, before an invading army threatened his father’s dominion. As his father’s people were retreating, he and a few other women of his tribe were abducted. They were taken to where his father was being held, and they watched as members of the army interrogated, tortured, and killed his father. This experience was very traumatic for Broteer. After this, at age 6 ½ years old, Broteer was sold into slavery and shipped to the Americas and given his new name Venture, by his master that purchased him (Smith).</p>
                            <p><strong>Life in Slavery: </strong>After a rigorous journey aboard a slave ship, they sailed from Africa to Barbados, and from Barbados to New England in America. There he was put to work by his master and was diligent in following orders. There were multiple attempts to punish Venture, but Venture easily overpowered those who tried to subdue him. Eventually, he met a slave named Meg, who would become his wife. After an attempt at running away, Venture was sold and was placed under the Stantons, a family in Connecticut. He convinced them to buy his wife, so she could live with him. After an altercation between his wife and Mrs. Stanton where he intervened, he was sold to a man named Oliver Smith. After working for Oliver Smith for quite some time, Venture bought his freedom. Because Oliver never betrayed him or was unfair, he took on the surname “Smith” (Sweet).</p>
                            <p><strong>Life in Freedom: </strong>After being freed, Venture set out to free the rest of his family. Meg and his two sons were still owned by the Stantons, and his eldest daughter was owned by a member of the Mumford family. After working as a whaler, he saved up enough money to buy his family. He eventually purchased some land in Connecticut. There they lived happily and free from the bondage of slavery. 20 years after this, he would publish his narrative (Sweet).</p>
                            <p><strong>Significance of Venture's Story: </strong>Venture’s story is significant because it shows us the experience of the African-American in the early days of the United States. He clearly depicts the hardships of slavery, and what it was like to be stolen from his home country. His life shows the largely different experience that he had, compared to the early white american colonists.</p>

                            <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>In 1731, on a plantation in Virginia, a girl was born. This little girl was given the name Martha Dandridge by her parents John Dandridge and Frances Jones. Her father owned a plantation that was around 500 acres, and the family was fairly well off when it came to finances (mountvernon.org). Growing up, Martha loved to ride horses, garden, sew, play piano, and dance. Her father made sure that she was well educated, learning basic math, reading and writing (ushistory.org).</p>
                            <p><strong>First Marriage: </strong>At 18 years old, Martha was married to a man named Daniel Parke Custis, who had high standing in colonial Virginia. He was extremely wealthy, and was about 20 years older than Martha was. With him, she had four children, two of which died in infancy. The other two children who survived were called John Parke, and Martha. After 8 years of marriage, Daniel contracted an illness, and died from it. This left Martha with two children to take care of, the duties of running the household, and the duties of running her husband’s estate. Luckily for her, her education as a youth helped her perform these tasks (ushistory.org).</p>
                            <p><strong>Meeting George Washington: </strong>With the large amount of tasks that Martha had to take care of, she considered remarriage. George Washington, a military man and planter, stopped by her place in between the battles he was fighting. While their first meeting isn’t recorded, the two of them quickly hit it off, and planned marriage. George was a well respected military leader, and Martha was a well-known wealthy widow. The match was made and the marriage took place. After that, Washington became a very wealthy man through his wife (mountvernon.org).</p>
                            <p><strong>Hardships: </strong>After their marriage life wasn’t easy. John Parke needed to go to school, and her daughter Martha, was progressively becoming more ill after a seizure when she was 12. At the age of 17, her daughter Martha passed away. It was devastating for her and the rest of the family. Tensions were rising as well on the war front. After the war, her son Jacky became ill as well, and died of “camp fever.” With the last of her children gone, Martha clung to her daughter-in-law and grandchildren (ushistory.org).</p>
                            <p><strong>Later Life: </strong>After the Revolutionary War was over, and after Martha and George had spent a good many years together, George caught a cold. In December of 1799, he passed away, before the turn of the new century. At this time he freed half of his slaves through his will, and Martha freed the rest in 1800. In 1802, Martha Washington passed away leaving a legacy and story that will touch the hearts of american people for centuries (ushistory.org).</p>
                            <p><strong>Significance of Martha's Life: </strong>Martha was the first “first lady” of the United States of America. Because of her, George became wealthy and was able to become the man that our country needed him to be. She was a strong mother and one who had endured many hardships. She is a powerful role-model of what a woman can be and accomplish in one lifetime.</p>

                            <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Black Hawk was born with the native american name Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak in the year 1767, in what is now known as Rock Island, IL. Not much is known about his early life, but what is known is that he quickly became an effective warrior, and was respected in his tribe (Lewis).</p>
                            <p><strong>Military Leadership: </strong>By the time Black Hawk had grown up, he had become a powerful military leader. He would become the chief of the Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, and Ho-Chunk peoples. He and many other leaders would oppose the United States when they tried to take their land for their own use. Black Hawk was willing to fight for the land of his people, so they had a safe place to live and raise families (Lewis).</p>
                            <p><strong>War of 1812: </strong>During the war of 1812, Black Hawk and his people would join the British in a few different engagements, and would earn himself and his tribe the name “British Band” (Lewis). While this was going on, the Sauk tribe would be contested between himself, and the pro-american leader Chief Keokuk (Wisconsin Historical Society). Keokuk was happy to comply with the demands of the United States and move his people to the state of Iowa. Black Hawk was not happy to comply. Although he did cross the Mississippi he would soon be back to fight for the land that was once his in Illinois (Lewis).</p>
                            <p><strong>The Black Hawk War: </strong>After re-settling in Iowa temporarily, Black Hawk and several men and women re-crossed the Mississippi to go contest the land that once was theirs. Black Hawk was under the impression that once they got there, they would be backed up by other native american tribes and the british, but it was to no avail. The british never showed up, and there weren’t enough native americans to make the stand. Although the first few battles went extremely well for Black Hawk and his small army, they would soon be overpowered, and forced to flee back over the Mississippi river. Over 300 native americans would meet their end in this war over land. Eventually, after losing so many people, Black Hawk surrendered, and returned to Iowa. There he would live with his family and tribe until he passed away in 1838 (Lewis).</p>
                            <p><strong>Significance of Black Hawk's Life: </strong>Black Hawk shows us clearly what it was like to be native americans trying to peaceably live in the land that was already theirs, only to be attacked by undeserving whites who wanted their land. The ideals of whites and their “manifest destiny” led to a devastating number of deaths of native americans all around the United States in the coming years. Through Black Hawk, we can experience the other side of people who were treated extremely unfairly.</p>
