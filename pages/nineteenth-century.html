                    <div class="story">
                        <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Both Angelina and Sarah Grimke were born in the south in the state of South Carolina. Sarah was Angelina’s godmother, the one who took care of her, so they had a tight bond. The two of them grew up on a plantation, where their father owned slaves. Their father was a very strict man, and would often have them out picking cotton or shelling corn, and they quickly got acquainted with the concept of slavery at an early age. As they grew up, the two of them began to detest slavery, and the awful treatment of the slaves. After their father passed away, Sarah, and eventually Angelina, both moved to Philadelphia (National Park Service).</p>
                        <p><strong>The Abolitionist Movement: </strong>After moving to Philadelphia, both sisters became Quakers, and Angelina wrote a letter to Wiliam Lloyd Garrison, one of the leaders of the abolitionist movement and publisher of the newspaper, “The Liberator”. In it, she encouraged him to continue to fight for the emancipation of slaves, even if it meant dying to do so. He ended up publishing her letter in his paper, and both Grimke sisters ended up getting much more involved in the movement (nps.gov). They became involved in the American Anti-Slavery Society, and held many group meeting with women in their homes (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica).</p>
                        <p><strong>Women's Rights: </strong>Angelina Grimke, after getting much more involved in the movement ended up writing an appeal to the “Christian Women of the South” basically telling women in the south that they should become involved in the movement, and that they did have the power to make change in this country. Because of this, and many more writings which she did on the equality of men and women, Angelina is known as one of the first women that was a part of the women’s rights movement as well as her sister Sarah (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica).</p>
                        <p><strong>Later Life: </strong>Eventually both Angelina and Sarah retired from public eye. Angelina got married to an abolitionist, and both her and Sarah retired to the state of Massachusetts. They both lived happily with their families until 1873 when Sarah passed away. 6 years later, Angelina would pass away as well. They both left legacies to inspire women, and ultimately were a large part of the success of the civil war and the liberation of the slaves (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica).</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance of Grimke Sisters' Lives: </strong>Both Sarah and Angelina Grimke helped start the movement that became women’s suffrage. They are true pioneers for women’s rights, and were a powerful influence in the abolitionist movement. Because of these two women, and many others, slaves were liberated, and women eventually got their rights.</p>

                    <div class="story">
                        <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Mary Tape was born in China in 1857. In 1868, she immigrated to San Francisco from Shanghai, China. Because she came without an adult, she was taken in by the Ladies’ Protection & Relief Society. While she lived there, she learned English and the American way. It was there that she gained the name Mary, named after Mary McGladery, the matron who looked after her. She also met a young milk boy named Joseph, who dropped off the milk where she stayed. Joseph ended up courting Mary in English, and after 6 months the two were married the christian way (nyhistory.org).</p>
                        <p><strong>The American Middle-Class Life: </strong>After the two were married, they tried to establish themselves. Joseph and Mary made their first home, and Joseph got a job as a shipper, where he would deliver boxes from ships to Chinatown. He also worked as an interpreter. Eventually, the couple had four children: Mamie, Frank, Emily and Gertrude. They were beginning to experience the normal American way of life when they ran into a problem: their children needed to be educated (nyhistory.org).</p>
                        <p><strong>Tape v. Hurley </strong>When Joseph and Mary tried to enroll their first child Mamie at the white only Spring Valley Primary School, the head of the school, Principal Hurley, denied her access based on the school board policy against admitting chinese children. Obviously, Mary did not see this as fair. She hired a lawyer and decided to sue the board of education for their decision. After the case rose to the supreme court, it was decided that because Mary and Joseph, and many other chinese immigrants, paid taxes that supported the schools, their children would be allowed to go to those same schools. The law was changed, and now permitted all children to go to school. This wasn’t the end though. They still were persecuted when they tried to enroll again. She wrote a letter to the board of education and asked them if it was a disgrace to be chinese. She explained that her chinese children were just like the caucasion children running around. Because the letter wasn’t responded to fast enough, her children were enrolled in a new chinese only public school (Pruitt).</p>
                        <p><strong>After Effects: </strong>Although their child Mamie did not get to attend the school that they had requested she attend, the Tape v. Hurley case allowed for other chinese children to enroll at non-segregated schools, and paved the way for the future of equality among races (Pruitt).</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance of Mary Tape's Life: </strong>Because of Mary Tape, and her willingness to sue the board of education, chinese children were allowed to go to non-segregated schools. While these effects may have been short lived before Plessy v. Ferguson was put into place, it started the journey towards race equality. Her account gives us a peak at what it was like to be a chinese immigrant in the 19th century.</p>

                    <div class="story">
                        <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Harriet Tubman was born on a plantation in Dochester County, Maryland. Her parents' names were Harriet Green and Benjamin Ross, and they originally named her Araminta Ross. Her mother worked as a cook on the plantation, and her father worked as a timber worker. Later, Araminta would change her name to Harriet, in honor of her mother. Harriet had 8 brothers and sisters, but because of the harshness of slavery, it was impossible to keep them altogether. Harriet quickly learned a hate of slavery, and would right injustice when she could. There was one time where another enslaved person was getting a rock thrown at them, and she jumped in the way to protect the other person. This left her with a head injury that would last the rest of her life (history.com).</p>
                        <p><strong>Escape from Slavery: </strong>In 1840, Harriet learned that her father was set free, and that her mother and the rest of the children were supposed to be set free as well. Their new owner though, didn’t follow through, and kept them in bondage. A couple years later, she married a man named John Tubman, but the marriage went south. She also learned that her owners were planning on selling her brothers, so she decided to plan an escape. In 1849, Harriet and her two brothers escaped. After leaving, the two brothers changed their minds and went back. Harriet, now on her own, kept moving forward (history.com).</p>
                        <p><strong>The Underground Railroad: </strong>It was the Underground Railroad that ensured Harriet’s safe arrival in Philadelphia. After she got there, she decided that she wanted to bring those she loved to safety, and became a conductor for the Underground Railroad. After the Fugitive Slave Act was put into place, it became very difficult to do her job. If people found out that there were runaway slaves in the North, they had a chance of being shipped back down to the south. Because of this, she led many up to Canada for safety. She also drugged many babies and young children to keep them quiet to avoid being captured or killed. It is said that she emancipated at least 70 different people in her time working the railroad (history.com).</p>
                        <p><strong>Later Years: </strong>Eventually, Harriet was able to settle down in Auburn, NY. Here she was active in the women’s rights movement, and continued to fight for racial equality. As she got older, she caught pneumonia, and on March 13, 1910, she passed away. Harriet Tubman was a woman of great strength, and an icon for people today (biography.com).</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance of Harriet Tubman's Life: </strong>Harriet Tubman was another amazing example of a person who was willing to lay down their life for what was right. She was a strong women who showed not only that African-Americans should be treated equal, but also showed what women were capable of. Because of her great accomplishments, she may end up on our $20 bill.</p>
