                    <div class="story">
                        <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Satsuki Ina was born in an internment camp near Tule Lake California in 1944. Just two years earlier in 1942, her parents' house and property was seized, and they were gathered up with thousands of other Japanese-Americans who were living here in the States. At first, her parents were held in a horse stable in South San Francisco, but then they were moved to the internment camp in Topaz, Utah. It was there that Ina’s older brother was born. Not long after that, they were moved to Tule Lake, CA where Satsuki would be born (Bernstein). At two years old, she would be reunited with her father, who was held in North Dakota at the time. Although she was young, children could still feel the constant fear that resided with the Japanese-Americans in those camps (Ina).</p>
                        <p><strong>Conditions of the Interment Camps: </strong>While Satsuki’s parents were living in the camps, they had to deal with a lot of different pressures. The internment camps themselves were surrounded by barbed wire fences, so they couldn’t escape, and those who tried to escape would be shot and killed. Those who lived there had uninsulated barracks, and only had a cot and a coal burning stove to keep themselves warm. As for facilities like bathrooms, hot water was usually pretty limited. They did still try to set up communities, where they would have schools, churches, and other places where you could participate together. Many families would stay in these camps for 3-4 years until they were released (Kuiper).</p>
                        <p><strong>Children of the Camps Project: </strong>Because of the traumatic experience of internment, Satsuki Ina has devoted a portion of her life to making sure the individuals who suffered in camps get the psychological treatment that they, or their kids might need. She also created a documentary called “Children of the Camps” to highlight those experiences that people had. She explains that in the DSM-IV it defines being taken hostage or being kidnapped in the list of experiences that cause trauma, and therefore many Japanese-Americans experienced a traumatic event. The goal of her project is to make sure that these Japanese-Americans are understood, and feel like they can talk about their experiences. She wants to bring healing to all those who felt betrayed by a country that was supposed to protect them (Ina).</p>
                        <p><strong>Later Life: </strong>Satsuki Ina has developed two different documentaries about these experiences, and brought awareness to the american people about that tragedy that happened so many years before. She sees the current conditions of the people of Mexico being held in captivity as a repeat of the treatment they experienced. She has conducted many protests against the way these people are being treated, and is active in helping people get the treatment they deserve (Bernstein).</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance of Satsuki Ina's Life: </strong>Satsuki Ina gives us a view of what it was like for Japanese-Americans in the time of WWII. She shows us the injustice that they received just because they happened to be Japanese. Again, racism struck in our history and prevented people from getting the rights they deserved. Here it is highlighted that the U.S. government has not always done good for it’s people.</p>

                    <div class="story">
                        <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Malcolm X was born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1925. His parents gave him the name Malcolm Little. His father Earl Little was a baptist preacher, and a supporter of the black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey. Because of his father’s involvement in civil rights, the family experienced many threats from the Ku Klux Klan, and the Black Legion, a smaller faction of the KKK. This led the family to move to Milwaukee, WI and then to Lansing, MI. Everywhere the family went though, racism followed. On one occasion, a racist mob came and lit their house on fire. The firemen and the police, who were white, refused to do anything. Their house burned to the ground. Two years later, Earl Little was found dead. His family believed that white supremacists had murdered him, but the local authorities put down his death as a streetcar accident, which voided the life insurance he had for his family. Their mother never recovered from the shock and grief of the event. She was committed to a mental institution, and the children were placed in foster homes. Malcolm dropped out of school at age 15, and became acquainted with the criminal underground, and began selling drugs (Biography.com Editors).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jail and the Nation of Islam: </strong>In 1946, Malcolm was arrested for larceny and was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison. During his time there, he educated himself with reading, and eventually converted to the Nation of Islam. At that point, he changed his name to Malcolm X. In 1952, he was released from prison. At this point he decided to more fully devote himself to the religion, and became a minister at two different temples. He encouraged his followers to eliminate racism by any means necessary, including violence. He grew the following from 400 to 40,000 members by 1960 (Biography.com Editors).</p>
                        <p><strong>Leaving the Nation of Islam: </strong>After hearing about his teacher Elijah Muhammad not following his own teachings, and having kids out of wedlock, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam. He felt betrayed and he was angry. He decided after that to travel to Africa and the Middle-East. It was there that he converted to traditional Islam, and found a true brotherhood. Coming back to the states he had a clearer mind and was less angry. He believed that it was possible for America to have a “bloodless” revolution (Biography.com Editors).</p>
                        <p><strong>Assassination: </strong>Just as he returned and was beginning to make speeches for the civil rights movement, he was assassinated on February 21, 1965. The culprits were a part of his previous religious group, the Nation of Islam (Biography.com Editors). Malcolm X predicted in his auto-biography, he would be more important and influential in his death, than in his life and he knew that he may die for the cause. And just as he predicted, he left a legacy that can never be lost (History.com Editors).</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance of Malcolm X's Life: </strong>Malcolm X shows us the brutal reality of the violence that many African-Americans experienced from the KKK, and other hate groups. He also shows us the more human approach of the civil rights movement, advocating violence as a tactic against the horrendous acts of white supremacists. His influence was powerful, just as Martin Luther King’s was.</p>

                        <p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Not much is known about General Vang Pao’s childhood, but we do know that he was born December 8, 1929, in Laos and is Hmong. When Vang Pao was only a teenager, he was recruited as a soldier during WWII. He fought the Japanese when they tried to invade Laos. Almost ten years later, he joined the French Army and fought the North Vietnamese who were attacking Laos at the time. Ever since Vang Pao was a young man, he was a patriot and one who was willing to die for his country (Burke).</p>
                        <p><strong>War Years: </strong>Between the years 1960-1975 the secret war took place. The secret war was a war between two Laotian governments, the Royal Lao and the Pathet Lao. Vang Pao was involved with the Royal Lao, and had spent a lot of time as part of their army. The United States, after hearing that the Pathet Lao were communist and trying to take over Laos, retaliated, and joined forces with the Royal Lao Army in attacking the Pathet Lao (legaciesofwar.org). Vang Pao, of course, because of his work with the army, became a General. For nearly 15 years, Vang Pao worked with leaders of the CIA to try and overpower the Pathet Lao. Eventually, the communist power overwhelmed the United States forces as well as the Royal Lao Army. By 1973, the United States had withdrawn from the war (Burke).</p>
                        <p><strong>Immigration to the United States: </strong>After the war was officially over, the United States agreed to bring thousands of refugees from Laos over to stay in the United States, including Vang Pao’s people: the Hmong. The Hmong were allowed to stay in 3 different states: California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. There they were able to settle, and enjoy a country that was not war-torn, and could finally live in peace. General Vang Pao, came to live out the remainder of his life in California. He served as a leader and a well respected guest at Hmong New Year celebrations, and other big Hmong events. In 2007 though, he was arrested over a conspiracy of eliminating the leaders of the communist government in Laos. After scouring over the evidence, they dropped the charges in 2009. Not long after his charges were dropped, General Vang Pao caught pneumonia. In 2011, after his health continued to get worse, he passed away. His legacy inspires thousands of Hmong people today (Burke).</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance of Vang Pao's Life: </strong>Vang Pao was a very influential leader and general during the secret war in Laos. He inspired many people, and helped the U.S. accomplish many of its goals while we were fighting in Laos. He knows what it is to be a minority in this country, and has helped thousands of Hmong people in the United States. His name should be remembered in history.</p>
